= AsciiDoc Guide [static copy of the EAP AsciiDoc Writing Guide]

IMPORTANT: This reference describes the structure and markup that should be used when writing topics, and was originally developed for the JBoss EAP 7 documentation. This static document is provided for convenience purposes only. A CCS-wide AsciiDoc Style Guide is under development as a part of the FY17 Quality Initiatives and will supplant this reference. The latest version of this document is always located in the `internal-resources` subdirectory of the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform documentation repository:

See additional sections below for xref:headings[heading], xref:tables[table title], and xref:images_and_screen_shots[image title] syntax.

[[headings]]
== Headings

* AsciiDoc headings use the `=` syntax and should be in title case. Headings should always be used for the book, chapter, and topic titles.
+
[listing]
----
= Installation Guide
----

* Because they generate an `<h#>` HTML tag, headings can also be used for sections or other headings that you want to appear in the book's table of contents.
* When building a book, the guide name is a top level (=) heading, chapters are level 2 (==), and sections, if included are level 3 (===) or more.
+
[listing]
----
= Getting Started Guide
== Introduction
// included topics ...
== Installing JBoss EAP
// included topics ...
== Running Your First Application
=== Downloading and Installing the Quickstarts
// included topics ...
=== Using JBoss Developer Studio to Run the Quickstarts
// included topics ...
----

* Included topic headings are adjusted to the correct heading level in the guide's `master.adoc` file using the `leveloffset` attribute.
+
[listing]
----
= Installation Guide
== Install the Product
  include::topics/download_the_zip.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
----

* Heading levels must be in sequence in a book. If you skip a level, you will see an error similar to the following:
+
[listing]
----
asciidoctor: WARNING: topics/review-getting-started-material.adoc: line 2: section title out of sequence: expected level 2, got level 3
----

* Because topics all use level 1 (=) headings, they must be adjusted by the appropriate integer to show up at the correct level in the guide.
** If a topic is included under a under a chapter, which is a level 2 (==) heading, it must render as a level 3 (===), so the `leveloffset` is "=+2"
**  If a topic is included under a under a level 3 section (===), it must render as a level 4 (===), so the `leveloffset` is "=+3".

* Do not use formatting, such as backticks (\`text`), in headings.  Using backticks in headings can cause text to get cut off in the table of contents on access.redhat.com.

* If the title text should not be numbered or appear in the table of contents, use a heading at the appropriate level, and then set the `discrete` attribute above the heading.
+
[listing]
----
[discrete]
== Management Console
The management console is...
----

[[topics]]
== Topics

* Always use a level 1 (=) heading for the topic title. Be sure to define an anchor using a lower case of the topic title delimited by underscores.
+
[listing]
----
[[jboss_eap_management]]
= {ProductShortName} Management
----
+
WARNING: Once a guide has been published to production, you should not change anchor names. This will break anything that is referencing that section, such as KCS articles and Windup migration rules.

* For subsections within a topic, use the next level heading only if you want the section to appear in the table of contents. Again, be sure to define a unique anchor for the section.
+
[listing]
----
[[management_users]]
== Management Users
----

* If the subsection title is generic, for example `Overview`, add something to the anchor to make it unique.
+
[listing]
----
[[management_overview]]
== Overview
----

* For subsection titles that should not be numbered or appear in the table of contents, use a heading at the appropriate level, and then set the `discrete` attribute above the heading.
+
[listing]
----
[discrete]
== Overview
----

[[procedures]]
== Procedures

AsciiDoc does not have specific syntax for procedures. Instead, use the following structure.

* If the topic is a procedure, then the topic title may be sufficient and an additional procedure title is not necessary.
+
[listing]
----
= Running the Quickstarts

Follow these instructions to run the quickstarts.

. Download the quickstarts from this URL.
. Extract the ZIP file.
----

* If the topic contains additional material or multiple procedures, you may need to include a title for the procedure.
** Use the discrete attribute (`[discrete]`) above the heading for the procedure title.
** The procedure title should be in title case.
** Do not precede it with "Procedure:".
+
For example:
+
[listing]
----
[discrete]
== Run the Quickstarts
----
* Use numbered lists for the steps.
+
[listing]
----
. Step 1
.. Step 1a
.. Step 1b
. Step 2
. Step 3
----
* Do not use titles or bold (*) text in steps.
* Do not use the `Result` title. Instead, only describe the result if it is necessary to understand the procedure outcome.

* The following is an example of how to write a procedure.
+
[listing]
----
[[installing_jboss_eap_zip_installation]]
= Installing {ProductShortName} (ZIP Installation)

. Move the downloaded ZIP file to the server and directory where you plan to install {ProductShortName}. The user who will start and stop the server must have read and write access to this directory.

. Use an appropriate application to extract the ZIP archive to the desired location.

* In a Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment, use the `unzip` utility to
extract the contents of the ZIP archive.
* In a Microsoft Windows environment, right-click the file and select *Extract All*.
* In a Hewlett-Packard HP-UX environment, use the `unzip` utility to
extract the contents of the ZIP archive.

The directory created by extracting the ZIP archive is the top-level directory for the server. This is referred to as `EAP_HOME`.
----

[[tables]]
== Tables

* Specify column width as a percentage in the table header.
+
----
[cols="20%,20%,20%,40%",options="header"]
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use empty commas to indicate the number of columns. The following syntax is difficult to read and can result in build or formatting errors:
----
[cols=",,,",options="header"]
----
====

* You can add a title to a table (using title case) by using the ".Table Title" syntax.  This will prepend a "Table #" in front of the title.
+
_For example, this:_
+
----
.Table Title
[cols="40%,60%",options="header"]
|===
|Column A | Column B
|Hello | Goodbye
|===
----
+
_will be rendered as this:_
+
.Table Title
[cols="40%,60%",options="header"]
|===
|Column A | Column B
|Hello | Goodbye
|===
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Be sure to use exactly 3 equal signs after the pipe for the beginning and ending table markup.

Also be sure to add a carriage return at the end of each row.
[source]
----
|===
|row 1, column 1 |row 1, column 2
|row 2, column 1 |row 2, column 2
|===
----
====


* If you need to use certain AsciiDoc formatting inside table cells, you may need to specify to apply the AsciiDoc styling by using an `a`.  This can be done either at either the column or cell level.
. Entire column - add `a` on the `cols` attribute of the table.
+
_For example, this:_
+
----
[cols="50%,50%a"]
|===
|* This list is not rendered since the column is missing the `a` syntax.
* This list is not rendered since the column is missing the `a` syntax.
|* This list is rendered properly.
* This list is rendered properly.
|===
----
+
_will be rendered as this:_
+
[cols="50%,50%a"]
|===
|* This list is not rendered since the column is missing the `a` syntax.
* This list is not rendered since the column is missing the `a` syntax.
|* This list is rendered properly.
* This list is rendered properly.
|===

. For a single cell - add an `a` before the separator of that cell.
+
_For example, this:_
+
----
[cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|* This list is not rendered since the cell is missing the `a` syntax.
* This list is not rendered since the cell is missing the `a` syntax.
a|* This list is rendered properly.
* This list is rendered properly.
|===
----
+
_will be rendered as this:_
+
[cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|
* This list is not rendered since the cell is missing the `a` syntax.
* This list is not rendered since the cell is missing the `a` syntax.
a|
* This list is rendered properly.
* This list is rendered properly.
|===

* Spanning and splitting cells in tables is covered in the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tables[Asciidoctor User Manual]. Most of the examples there are fairly simple. This example splits a cell in the 3rd column to span 2 rows. It is accomplished by prefixing the span factor with a ".".
+
_For example, this:_
+
----
[cols="16%,28%,28%,28%",options="header"]
|===
|Column 1 |Column 2 |Column 3 |Column 4
|Row 1
a|* Row1-Column2-Item1
* Row1-Column2-Item1
* Row1-Column2-Item1
|
|

.2+|Row 2

[[links]]
== Links

[[links_to_external_urls]]
=== Links to External URLs

When linking to an external URL, Asciidoctor recognizes the http, https, ftp, irc, mailto, and email@email.com schemes and generates the correct markup syntax to turn them into URLs. There is no need to explicitly add the `link:` prefix.

.Example of Syntax
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Developer_Studio/[_Install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio_] for complete installation instructions.
----

.Example of Rendered URL
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Developer_Studio/[_Install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio_] for complete installation instructions.


[[links_to_sections_within_the_same_guide]]
=== Links to Sections Within the Same Guide

When referring to another section or topic within the same guide, do not use the [x-]`<<section_title_anchor>>` syntax. Instead, create an anchor and use the 'xref:' syntax to provide the link. Replace spaces in the section title with underscores.

. Create a unique anchor at the top of the section using double brackets.The anchor should be lowercase with underscores.
+
The anchor must be unique within the guide. You will get build errors if there are duplicate anchors.

        [[section_header]]
        ==== Section Header

. Then use `xref` to create the link within the guide.

[[links_to_sections_or_topics_in_another_guide]]
=== Links to Sections or Topics In Another Guide

To create a link to a section or topic in a different guide, first create the unique anchor in the other guide or topic, then create the reference using `link:` syntax and the document attribute defined for the URL to the other guide.

. Create an anchor within the guide or topic.

. Then reference it from another page using the document attribute defined for that document URL. Because it is a relative URL, you must include the `link:` syntax:

+

[[images_and_screen_shots]]
== Images and Screen Shots

.General Rules

* Refer to The IBM Style Guide pp 94-95 for guidance about screen shot capture.
* Do not include the browser title bar or anything that indicates the type of browser that is used.
* Do not capture internal URLs or user names. Make sure that nothing personally identifiable is in the screen shot.
+
.Screen Shot with Personal Information
image:personal-info-screen-shot.png[Image with personal inforamation]

* Use a tool such as the Google Chrome extension "Window Resizer" to ensure the browser window is a set size before taking the screenshot. This helps ensure that all screenshots are of standard dimensions.

* Resize your browser window, or only capture the area you need to show the audience.

* Consider using a GIF if you've documented an action in a GUI which is hard to describe. For information about how to create them, see https://mojo.redhat.com/groups/ecs/blog/2015/01/05/creating-animated-gifs-from-a-series-of-stills[Creating Animated GIFs from a Series of Images] and https://mojo.redhat.com/groups/ecs/blog/2015/01/05/creating-animated-gifs-from-a-series-of-stills[Creating Animated GIFs from a Series of Images].

For more information, see https://mojo.redhat.com/groups/ecs/blog/2014/05/05/notes-on-capturing-screenshots-for-product-documentation[Notes on Capturing Screenshots for Product Documentation]

.Optimizing for the Customer Portal

* JPGs or PNGs are the preferred file format.
* The preferred screenshot width dimension for basic screen shots is between 1280px and 1440px.
* Try to keep screen shot size less than 300 KB if possible.

The complete guidelines and recommendations for capturing screenshots for use in the Customer Portal can be reviewed in this document: https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1058927[Customer Portal Screenshot Guidelines and Recommendations].

.Syntax

* Insert a block-level image, which uses a double colon (`::`).  Good for screenshots, diagrams, etc.  Optionally include an image title in title case (which automatically appends a Figure #).
+
_For example, this:_
+
----
.Image Title
image::icon.png[Alt text, 50, 50]
----
+
_will be rendered as this:_
+
.Image Title
image::icon.png[Alt text, 50, 50]
* Insert an inline image.  Note, there is only one colon (`:`) used here.
+
_For example, this:_
+
----
This is an inline image. image:icon.png[Alt text] Cool!
----
_will be rendered as this:_
+
This is an inline image. image:icon.png[Alt text] Cool!



[[listing_and_source_blocks]]
== Listing and Source Blocks

Source, commmand, and output examples are displayed using style blocks and the example code is preceded and followed by a line with four dashes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be sure to use exactly 4 dashes for the beginning and ending of the style block:

 [source]
 ----
 xyz
 ----

====

It is recommended to use the `options="nowrap"` argument so that the example lines do not wrap.

The code block specified depends on the type of example.

[[xml_source_code_block_syntax]]
=== XML Source Code Block Syntax

* Set the style on the block to source.
* Specify `xml` for the source language to enable XML syntax highlighting in the rendered output.

[[terminal_command_source]]
=== Terminal Command Source

NOTE: Previously, we recommended applying the `bash` style to the terminal command block, but this caused issues when using a `#` for root commands as it was rendered as a bash comment.

* Set the `options="nowrap"` argument to prevent the text from wrapping.
* Start the command with a `$` to indicate that it is a terminal command executed as a normal user, or start the command with a `#` to indicate that it is a terminal command executed as the root user.
* When running commands/scripts within the `EAP_HOME` directory, provide the full path from `EAP_HOME`

[[conditional_macros]]
== Conditional Macros

AsciiDoc supports conditional include, exclude, and evaluate macros. These are  similar to the `condition="VALUE"` sysntax that was used in DocBook XML. You first define a conditional variable, then test for it to include or exclude it from the guide.

[[define_the_conditional_variable]]
=== Define the Conditional Variable

Each guide defines a document attribute matching its folder name in the `master.adoc` file. The document attribute does not need a value. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
  :development-guide:
----


[[including_text_in_guides]]
=== Including Text in Guides

To include text for the topic included in a specific guide, use the `ifdef::` directive followed by a comma-delimited list of guides that should include the text. Use `endif::` with the same list to end the macro.

.Include the Text in the development-guide
[source,asciidoc]
----
  ifdef::development-guide[]
  For more information, see xref:test_b_summary[Test B Summary].

[[excluding_text_from_a_guide]]
=== Excluding Text from a Guide

To include text for the topic included in all but the named guides, use the `ifndef::` directive followed by a comma-delimited list of guides that should include the text. Use `endif::` with the same list to end the macro.

.Include the Text in All Guides Except the development-guide
[listing]
----
  ifndef::development-guide[]

[[including_text_based_on_evaluation_of_a_document_attribute_value]]
=== Including Text Based on Evalution of a Document Attribute Value

You can also include text based on the value of a document attribute.

Say for example you define the following document attribute:
[listing]
----
 :version: {ProductRelease}

 ifeval::[{version} >= 6]
 This is the latest release.
 endif::[]

 ifeval::[{version} >= 7]
 We are referring to the current release.

[[document_attributes]]
== Document Attributes

Document attributes allow you to define variables for content that may change at some point. They can be used for product names, product versions, URLs, or other content. You define them once and they are replaced during the build process. They are defined using leading and ending colon, for example
[listing]
----
:ProductDownloadURL: http://www.jboss.org/products/eap/download/
----

AsciiDoc also has many predefined document attributes, such as `:toc:`, `:toclevels:, ` and `:imagesdir:`.

Our custom document attributes are defined in the link:../docs/topics/templates/document-attributes.adoc[topics/templates/document-attributes.adoc] file.

More detailed information about document attributes can be found in the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/#document-attributes[Document attributes] of the _AsciiDoc Writer's Guide_  and in the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[Attributes] section of the _Asciidoctor User Manual_.

.Including Document Attributes in a Guide

Document attributes are defined in the `master.adoc` file for each guide. Simply include the `topics/templates/document-attributes.adoc` file in the document. Additional custom document attributes specific to the guide can also be included in this file. Any attributes defined in the `master.adoc` file will be automatically recognized within any included files.

[listing]
----
:toc:
:toclevels: 3
:numbered:

include::topics/templates/document-attributes.adoc[]
:ProductDownloadURL: http://www.jboss.org/products/eap/download/

:imagesdir: topics/images

= Installation Guide

== Product Overview
----

.Using Document Attributes in a Topic

To use a document attribute, enclose it in curly braces ({}).

[listing]
----
{ProductName} {ProductRelease} is a middleware platform built on open standards and compliant with the Java Enterprise Edition 7 specification.
----

The example will render with the variable replacements:

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 is a middleware platform built on open standards and compliant with the Java Enterprise Edition 7 specification.

[NOTE]
====
If you specify an invalid attribute name, for example `{ProductNamMisspelled}`, the guide will display the attribute declaration instead of the substitution value in the rendered guide. It is a good idea to search the rendered guides for instances of the variable names. Values to search on include
  `{Prod` and `URL}`
====

.Using Document Attributes in a Code Block

By default, if you attempt to use an attribute in a code block, the attribute will not be substituted. To overcome this, you can set `subs="attributes+"` on the code block so that attributes included in it will be substituted with their respective value. See the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#applying-substitutions[Applying substitions] section of the _Asciidoctor User Manual_ for more information.

For example:

  [options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
  ----
  $ unzip jboss-eap-{ProductVersion}-incremental-maven-repository.zip
  ----

will render as:

[options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ unzip jboss-eap-{ProductVersion}-incremental-maven-repository.zip

[[asciidoc_hints_and_tips]]
== AsciiDoc Hints and Tips


* The build generates anchors at the beginning of each page and section using lowercase letters and replacing spaces in the name with underscores. To prevent duplicate anchor names, and to maintain stability for links, you should specify an explicit anchor within double brackets.

        [[installation_introduction]]
        ==== Introduction
+
WARNING: Once a guide has been published to production, you should not change anchor names. This will break anything that is referencing that section, such as KCS articles and Windup migration rules.

* When creating code blocks, use 4 dashes ("----") to begin and end it, and add the "[options="nowrap"]" directive preceding the block, otherwise the code will wrap when the HTML is created.

        [options="nowrap"]
        ----
        code goes here...
        ----

* When displaying source code, use the appropriate language. See  xref:listing_and_source_blocks[Listing and Source Blocks] above for details.

* When using numbered lists with complex content, such as additional lines of text, tables, or images, use `+` on a line by itself between additional content to keep it connected with the list item above it.  This way, the numbering won't reset for your next list item.
+
For example, this:
+
....
. First item
. Second item
+
Additional content
+
----
code snippet
----
. Third item
....
+
It will render as this:
+
. First item
. Second item
+
Additional content
+
----
code snippet
----
. Third item

* In Asciidoctor 1.5.0, the backtick is no longer an inline monospaced literal. This means that the wildcard character (*) within backticks renders as an emphasis tag, resulting in the following build error.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
parser error : Opening and ending tag mismatch
----
+
To escape wildcard (*) or other characters within backticks so they render exactly as typed, you must precede them with `[x-]`, for example:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
[x-]`org.apache.commons.{*}`
----
This is described in further detail here: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/1045

* Asciidoctor renders certain punctuation and text combinations as formatting markup. For example, the acronym Transaction Manager \(TM) would be rendered as a trademark (TM).
+
Use a backslash (\) to prevent punctuation from being interpreted as formatiing markup. When your document is processed, the backslash is removed so it does not display in the output.

+
[options="nowrap"]
----
\*Stars* will appear as *Stars*, not as bold text.
\&sect; will appear as an entity reference, not the &sect; symbol.
\\__func__ will appear as __func__, not as emphasized text.
\{two-semicolons} will appear {two-semicolons}, not resolved as ;;.
----
+

[[to_be_reviewed]]
== To Be Reviewed
This is an area to put style guideline proposals or questions that need to be reviewed.  Once a decision has been made, they will be added as an entry to the guide.

WARNING: Items in this list are *not* to be taken as guidance yet.

. How do we want to handle showing commands for Linux vs. Windows?  We tend to do something like:
.. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
+
----
EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
----
.. For Microsoft Windows Server.
+
----
EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
----
+
However, this is a bit deceiving since the standalone.sh command is also used for Solaris (and HP-UX?), but not just RHEL.  But I defnitely don't want to say "For Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Solaris, or HP-UX" everywhere!  Windows is pretty much the oddball, one option could be to say upfront that all of our commands assume you're using some sort of Unix, then default everywhere to that (like standalone.sh), and have a specific callout afterwards for Windows?  Thoughts on this or other options?
. When showing instructions for doing something in standalone mode or domain mode, always show standalone first.  Any other guidance on how to go about showing domain mode commands/instructions?  Domain mode CLI commands are usually very similar to standalone mode, but just with the appropriate /profile= or /host= in front.  Should we display the entire command for domain mode, or tell them to precede w/ the appropriate option?  Thoughts?

== Writing Style Guide References

This document covers formatting styles. It does not cover writing styles and is not intended to replace the Red Hat Technical Publications http://stylepedia.net[Writing Style Guide]. The _Usage Dictionary_ in part II provides guidelines for the correct use of common terms in Red Hat documentation, which terms to avoid, and the preferred spelling if variations exist. Also see guidelines in the https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-28115[Corporate Style Guide]. The _IBM Style Guide_ is also an approved reference for correct usage information.

Here are a few basic reminders.

* Use "see" to refer readers to another resource. Avoid using "refer to" in this context.
